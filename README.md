# MATLAB AI Assistant

## How to Use:
1. Download this Repository to your local MATLAB environment as a zip file.
2. Replace "api_key" in MATLAB_AI_Assistant/ai_query.m with your OPEN API KEY.
3. Run addpath(pwd). Now all functions in this package are available in MATLAB.
4. To test, run "ai_query("what MATLAB function can I use to capitalize a string?")!

## üåü Inspiration
I wanted to build a MATLAB package that would help me learn to use all of the major libraries in MATLAB. Upon thinking about the biggest roadblocks in developing in MATLAB, I realized that I spent a lot of time outside of the development environment. I theorized that I'd be able to program faster if I could ask my questions directly in the MATLAB command window instead of using Google, Stack Overflow, and the MATLAB website.

## üöÄ Overview & Features
The main functions of this package are to enable asking programming questions directly in the command window and enabling easier access to the official MATLAB docs within the development environment. This combination ends up being helpful and makes it a lot easier to stay inside MATLAB when you're coding, even when you run into questions or errors. This project was coded entirely in MATLAB, utilizes the Open AI API and MATLAB library.

## üèóÔ∏è Challenges & Accomplishments
The biggest challenge I faced implementing this was the design of the command window responses and connecting the API's. I tried to ensure that responses are minimalist to ease the amount of clutter in the development environment, which required a lot of output iterations.

What's next for MATLAB AI Assistant
I plan to utilize this package whenever I'm coding in MATLAB in the future and will see what features I'd like to add as I determine more points where I can add functionality to ease the process of programming.
