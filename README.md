Inspiration
[replace] We wanted to build a sustainable project which gave us the idea to plant crops on a farmland in a way that would give the farmer the maximum profit. The program also accounts for crop rotation which means that the land gets time to replenish its nutrients and increase the quality of the soil.

What it does
[replace] It does many things, It first checks what crops can be grown in that area or land depending on the weather of the area, the soil, the nutrients in the soil, the amount of precipitation, and much more information that we have got from the APIs that we have used in the project. It then forms a plan which accounts for the crop rotation process. This helps the land regain its lost nutrients while increasing the profits that the farmer is getting from his or her land. This means that without stopping the process of harvesting we are regaining the lost nutrients. It also gives the farmer daily updates on the weather in that area so that he can be prepared for severe weather.

How we built it
[replace] For most of the backend of the program, we used Python. For the front end of the website, we used HTML. To format the website we used CSS. we have also used Javascript for formates and to connect Python to HTML. We used the API of Twilio in order to send daily messages to the user in order to help the user be ready for severe weather conditions.

Challenges we ran into
[replace] The biggest challenge that we faced during the making of this project was the connection of the Python code with the HTML code. so that the website can display crop rotation patterns after executing the Python back end script.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
[replace] While making this each of us in the group has accomplished a lot of things. This project as a whole was a great learning experience for all of us. We got to know a lot of things about the different APIs that we have used throughout the project. We also accomplished making predictions on which crops can be grown in an area depending on the weather of the area in the past years and what would be the best crop rotation patterns. On the whole, it was cool to see how the project went from data collection to processing to finally presentation.

What we learned
[replace] We have learned a lot of things in the course of this hackathon. We learned team management and time management, Moreover, we got hands on experience in Machine Learning. We got to implement Linear Regression, Random decision trees, SVM models. Finally, using APIs became second nature to us because of the number of them we had to use to pull data.

What's next for ECO-HARVEST
[replace] For now, the data we have is only limited to the United States, in the future we plan to increase it to the whole world and also increase our accuracy in predicting which crops can be grown in the area. Using the crops that we can grow in the area we want to give better crop rotation models so that the soil will gain its lost nutrients faster. We also plan to give better and more informative daily messages to the user in the future.
